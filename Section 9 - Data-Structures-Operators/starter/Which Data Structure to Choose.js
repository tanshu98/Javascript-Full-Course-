//  Dealing and Working with data is the main thing we do as developers
// We have 4 Data Structures form which we can choose..

// Where can data actually come form?

// 1. The Data can be written within the pgm source code itself like status messages that will be displayed on the web page based on user actions

// 2. Data can come from user-interface i.e from the webpage. So it can either be data that the user inputs into some form or data that is already written somehow in the DOM

// 3. From External Sources - Usually Web API's
// Application Program Interface
// SO basically we can use Web API's to get data from other web Applications

// So..no matter where the data comes from..and what kind of data it is..we usually have collections of data..that we then need to store somewhere

// Now we store this collection of data in the data structures
// And Js has 4 built-in Data Structures

// Now..if there's a simple list which we have to store..then we use Arrays or Sets..
// If there's a data which is a key value pair..then we use objects or Maps

// Now the data which we get from the Web API's is in the form of Json..
// Its basically a colleciton of Array of Objects
